    <div>Quickly create a list of your assignments in Microsoft Teams:
    </div>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to https://teams.microsoft.com</li>
    <li>Sign in, if necessary</li>
    <li>Click on Assignments in the far left navigation bar</li>
    <li>Click the cupcake icon in the top right</li>
    <li>Wait about ten seconds and the report will be displayed</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Options</h2>
  <div>To filter out assignments you don't want to see, enter words
    or phrases, one per line. For example, if you never want to see
    assignments containing "extra credit" or by the teacher Mr. Macinerny,
    then type each on its own line.
  </div>
  <br>
  <form id="options-form">
      <label for="options">Remove assignments with these words or phrases:</label>
      <br>
      <textarea id="options" rows="10" cols="50"></textarea>
      <br>
      <input type="submit">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <b><span id="saved" style="color: mediumpurple"></span></b>
    </form>
    <p><em>Search text is
    case-insensitive, which means that "extra credit" and "EXTRA CREDIT"
    will both work.</em></p>
